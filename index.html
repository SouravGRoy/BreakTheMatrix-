Andrew Tate, 36, and his brother Tristian Tae, 34 were arrested in December 2022 for alleged charges of human trafficking, rape, pornographic shooting, and several more criminal charges.</p>
<p>Despite denying all the accusations, Andrew Tate is still under legal watch. His plea against the detention has been written off for the second time by a Roman court. It means that ‘Top G’ and his brother will remain imprisoned till February 27 at least.</p>

<p>However, the timeline could have possibly been extended. As reported by The Mirror.Co.UK, the Tate brothers can also have another four months of prison after their second appeal got rejected. If such is the case, then Andrew Tate and Tristian Tate won’t be released until June.</p>

<p>Romanian prosecutors have accused the Tates of heading a criminal gang to sexually exploit women. They claim the pair seduced women and then forced them to produce pornographic content, generating huge income that they regularly showed off on social media.

    A judge has yet to decide on Wednesday’s appeal against the decision to hold them for another 30 days.</p>
    <p>According to the Tate brothers, assets worth £3 million have also been seized from their side, which includes million-dollar cars too.</p>
